# WDI-MELB-2_Homework
Herewithin please find the learnings of one Justin Leigh Ward.

#### Justin is being expertly schooled by the honorable Daniel Tsui and right royal Matthew Swan

It's all happening at General Assembly in Melbourne. A link to the global *GA* site is [here](https://www.generalassemb.ly)

The class mates are all very friendly with a diverse range of skills. I am the only PC user (other than Matt) but I think 
Rubymine as an IDE has by back. It can also handle NodeJS, and of course includes git integration.

Here is what I am hoping to get out of the class written in an unordered list:
+ To be either self sufficient in backend web development or...
+ work as a valuable member of a web development team.
+ to meet fellow coders that speaka [sic] the same language
+ to be challenged and solve problems.

This is an attempt at a table showing a winning noughts and crosses game graphic only because you can in markdown in github.

| Noughts | and | Crosses |
|:---: |:---:|:---:|
|X|-|O|
|-|X|-|
|O|-|X|

O was *not* played by deep thought. It would have done somewhat better.
