    <h1>Like Sand Through the Hourglass...</h1>

    <p>We have built an array that contains the days of the week, but for some reason (we're very fussy) we don't like it how we made it and we want to change it...</p>

    <p>The array looks like this when we first create it...</p>
    <div id='originalTable'></div>

    <h2>Move Last To First</h2>
    <p>We then are asked to move Sunday to the beginning of the week, because we are of the "Weeks start on Sunday!" school of thinking.</p>
    <div id='moveLastToFirst'></div>

    <h2>UPPERCASE FRIDAYS!</h2>
    <p>Now, we've decided that Friday is the most SUPER AWESOME DAY OF THE WEEK EVER AND IT MUST BE IN UPPERCASE!</p>
    <div id='uppercaseFriday'></div>

    <h2>Break weekdays and weekend up</h2>
    <p>Week-days and weekends are completely different right? So they should be split up, right? Right?</p>
    <div id="weekdayNewArray"></div>
    <div id="weekendNewArray"></div>

    <h2>Bogan Pride for Wednesday!</h2>
    <p>Did you not know? Bogans LOVE Wednesdays and stubbies!</p>
    <div id="boganPride"></div>

    <h2>I decree weekdays no longer be!</h2>
    <p>For all too see let there no long be a weekday to see!</p>
    <div id="weekdayGone"></div>

    <h2>Primary School Organisation of Days</h2>
    <p>Lastly, we decided to get back to our roots and try to figure out what order the alphabet is in. By ordering this array. Alphabetically. Sure why not ^_^</p>
    <div id="alphabeticallyOrdered"></div>
