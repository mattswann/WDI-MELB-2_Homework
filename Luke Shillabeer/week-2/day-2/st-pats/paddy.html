    This leprechaun likes to hear VERY specific sentences. He's weird like that.
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe wish him "Happy St Patrick's"</li>
      <li>It's your round, ask him "Do you want a pint of Guinness?" (he's a little hard of hearing though...)</li>
      <li>Once he's responded to you buying a round, let him know it's his turn "Paddy, it's your round.".</li>
