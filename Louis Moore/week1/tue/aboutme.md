# Today at GA

We also threw together some code for our fortune teller exercise towards the afternoon:


```
var x = 2; //children
var y = 'Hannah'; //partner name
var z = 'Melbourne'; //location
var v = 'student'; //occupation

console.log("You will be a " + v + " in " + z + " and married to " + y + " with " + x + " kids.");
```
