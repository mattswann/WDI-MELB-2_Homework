/*
Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

Write a function named calculateAge that:

takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years. outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
Call the function three times with different sets of values.
Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
*/

function calculateAge (birthYear, currentYear) {
	if (current === undefined) {}
	return currentYear - birthYear;
	currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
}
var age = calculateAge(1965, 2015)
//console.log("you are either " + birthYear + " or " + currentYear)

}
