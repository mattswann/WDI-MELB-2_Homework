/*
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

Write a function named calculateSupply that:
takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age). outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
*/



function calculateSupply (age, amountPerDay) {
	var maxAge = 82;

	var amountConsumed = (maxAge - age) * amountPerDay * 365;

	console.log('you will need ' + Math.round + amountConsumed + ' to last you until the ripe old age of ' +  maxAge)

}
var age = calculateSupply (); //equals 980
