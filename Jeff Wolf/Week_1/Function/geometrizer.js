/*
Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle.

Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
Create a function called calcArea:

Pass the radius to the function.
Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".
