# GA WDI Melbourne
## Day 1

***

### The necessary preamble

A bit of a mixed bag today. Kicked off with an intro to the course by James, as well as various housekeeping items. This included:
- General structure of the course and what to expect each day
- The expected 'introduce the person next to you' thing
- Writing down our fears, excitements and goals for the course; for me it included not picking up new things, learning new languages, and get a job post-course.
- Coming up with the class culture; ie. things we'll abide by in class (eg. Be excellent to each other)

The outcomes producer Johnathan spoke to us about what we can expect from GA in terms of assistance/guidance in getting work after the course. It was highlighted that it's a 50/50 thing and that we're expected to be a very active participant in the process, __which is more than fair__. Sounds like we'll be given some great opportunities to get our faces in front of people who are hiring.

### The real stuff!

We eventually got into some learning, and this covered:
- the terminal command line
- Git
- Github
- background on JavaScript (DT not a huge fan it would seem)
- some basic JS

Essentially today covered ground that was part of the WDI Fundamentals material, but it was good to go over it again. I think it will be more of the same tomorrow, at least in part.

There was a small piece of homework, which included writing some content in Markdown. May as well make it a blog entry (yes, that's this).

A nice bonus was a free lunch (hey, they do exist!) at a place called [Mr Banks](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1740738/restaurant/CBD/Mr-Banks-Melbourne).

Things to keep in mind going forward:
1. be on time
2. do the homework
3. embrace the unknown
4. get involved outside of class (eg. meetups)
